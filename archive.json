Integrated Encryption and Key Encryption use the same \"alg\" values on purpose. And JWK key_ops turns out to be totally busted.\r\n- Forbidding this practice can be expected to cause significant operational issues.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related, because HPKE AAD for Key Encryption is significant for preventing any issues with mixing key wrapping and content encryption.\r\n\r\nAnd some notes about fields used:\r\n- AlgorithmID is not well-defined for Key Encryption. HPKE already binds its ciphersuite, so \"alg\" is redundant. However, using \"enc\" here would protect against bad implementations that allow unsafe bulk ciphers.\r\n- SuppPubInfo contains key length, which is meaningless for HPKE.\r\n- SuppPrivInfo is always empty.\r\n\r\nUsing len32(enc) || enc || len32(PartyUInfo) || PartyUInfo || len32(PartyVInfo) || PartyVInfo as aad for Key Encryption would guarantee safety of mixing key wrapping and content encryption (as nobody is going to use 1.5GB+ enc values).",

      "author": "awoie",

      "assignees": [],
      "labels": [],
      "body": "For various reasons, it makes sense to introduce a mechanism to support **\"detached\" JWE AAD** where the Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) for a JWE is not transmitted in-band but is instead derived by the sender and receiver from contextual information out-of-band. This approach can enhance **security**, **efficiency**, and **flexibility**.\r\n\r\n### Use Case: Mitigating the \"Lazy Verifier\" Problem\r\nOne specific use case arises from **OID4VC**, where detached JWE AAD could help mitigate the so-called \"lazy verifier\" problem. \r\n\r\nIn this scenario:\r\n- A verifier website sends a request to a wallet (typically a native mobile app).\r\n- The wallet responds with an encrypted message, including contextual information (e.g., the request's origin) as part of the AAD in the JWE response.\r\n\r\nThis contextual information is authenticated via AEAD but may not be validated by a \"lazy verifier,\" which skips verifying these fields against their expected values based on the established context. This lack of validation makes the system prone to phishing attacks. For example, the wallet might encode the origin where it received the verifier's request in the AAD, e.g., attacker.com. However, if the verifier does not verify this information, an attacker could exploit the oversight.\r\n\r\nBy requiring the verifier to derive the JWE AAD from contextual information rather than transmitting it in-band:\r\n- The AAD becomes more tightly bound to the verifier's session and context.\r\n- It eliminates the need for explicit validation of the AAD, as the verifier computes it directly from its established session context.\r\n- This reduces the attack surface, making phishing attacks harder to execute.\r\n\r\n### Need for a Generalized Solution\r\nSince **\"detached\" JWE AAD** is not currently defined in the JWE specification and applies to other encryption algorithms (e.g., ECDH-ES), a more general solution could be developed. This would be especially relevant for OID4VC, which uses JARM (JWT Secured Authorization Response Mode, using the JWE compact form) to send encrypted responses. Ensuring compatibility with the JWE compact form would be critical.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\n#### JWE JSON Serialization (already supports dedicated `aad` parameter)\r\nFor JWE JSON serialization, the existing `aad` parameter could indicate that the AAD is detached by setting its value to `null`. \r\n\r\n#### JWE Compact Serialization (no dedicated `aad` parameter yet)\r\nFor JWE compact serialization, the format could be extended to optionally include the AAD as an additional segment:\r\n- **Extended Format**: `<Protected Header>.<Encrypted Key>.<Initialization Vector>.<Ciphertext>.<Authentication Tag>.<AAD>`\r\n- **Behavior**:\r\n  - If the `AAD` segment is empty or omitted (e.g., `<Protected Header>.<Encrypted Key>.<Initialization Vector>.<Ciphertext>.<Authentication Tag>.`), it signals that the AAD is detached and must be computed or derived from contextual information by the sender and receiver.\r\n  - The computation of AAD for the AEAD algorithm would follow the same logic as for the JWE JSON form.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- **JWE Compact Form without AAD** (Standard): `<Protected Header>.<Encrypted Key>.<Initialization Vector>.<Ciphertext>.<Authentication Tag>`\r\n- **JWE Compact Form with AAD**: `<Protected Header>.<Encrypted Key>.<Initialization Vector>.<Ciphertext>.<Authentication Tag>.<AAD>`\r\n- **JWE Compact Form with Detached AAD**: `<Protected Header>.<Encrypted Key>.<Initialization Vector>.<Ciphertext>.<Authentication Tag>.`\r\n\r\n### Relevance to OID4VC\r\nThis approach could address challenges in **OID4VC**, particularly in ensuring robust validation of contextual information by the verifier without relying on error-prone implementations. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- Issue [openid/oid4vc-haip#131](https://github.com/openid/oid4vc-haip/issues/131)\r\n- Issue [openid/OpenID4VP#347](https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VP/issues/347)\r\n- Issue [openid/OpenID4VP#65](https://github.com/openid/OpenID4VP/issues/65)",

Turns out it does support Key Encryption, also using a public trait for algorithm.\n\nThe relevant method does not take any headers as input, but does take algorithm-specific settings.

Then the recipient decrypts it as the CEK of the original message, which is presumably malformed message, and then proceed to leak information about the CEK. Which is bad.\n\nThe way to fix this is to have proper cryptographic separation between modes. So using protected headers (which does not give cryptographic separation) does not just cause implementation issues, it also causes security risks.\n\n(COSE-HPKE does have cryptographic separation of 1- and 2-layer structures, done in way that minimizes implementation issues and defends against the \"LAMPS attack\".)",

Remove text that \"The protected header used in content encryption is passed to HPKE as Additional Authenticated Data.\"\n2. Explicitly say that \"protected header is used as AAD during the content encryption phase, when encrypting the payload using the CEK.\"\n3. HPKE-based Key Encryption and Integrated Encryption modes are cryptographically separated through the construction of the HPKE info parameter.\n\nThe info parameter is constructed by concatenating the following ASCII-encoded values in order:\n\na. A fixed context string (\"JOSE-HPKE\"),\n\nb. A mode identifier (\"keyenc\" for Key Encryption mode or \"intenc\" for Integrated Encryption mode),\n\nc. The value of the alg header parameter,\n\nd. The value of the enc header parameter.\n\nNo separators are added between the concatenated values.\n\nThis context binding ensures that ciphertexts generated for Key Encryption mode cannot be validly interpreted as ciphertexts for Integrated Encryption mode, and vice versa. Thus, even if an attacker tampers with the JOSE header fields or attempts to cause mode confusion, the derived keys will differ and decryption will fail safely without leaking sensitive information. This approach is similar to the key derivation techniques adopted in ietf-lamps-cms-cek-hkdf-sha256.",

Authenticated KEMs provide authentication at the KEM level, which has different implications depending on whether they are used for key\nencryption or integrated encryption. In integrated encryption, the KEM operations directly secure the message plaintext. In key encryption,\nthe KEM operations secure the content encryption key. Using authenticated KEMs for key encryption does not provide meaningful security\nbenefits and will create a false sense of data origin authentication.\n\n2. The PQ/T Hybrid KEM in HPKE is not an authenticated KEM and can only be used with HPKE Base mode. Similarly, PQ KEMs in HPKE are not authenticated KEMs, making them incompatible with an authenticated KEM approach. \n\n",

Or, resigned and barring that, at least be forthright about it in the document itself.\n\nIt's my sense that the authors and many working group members understood your request to not differ from the way JWE works today, but the problem is that HPKE integrated encryption works differently than any of the algorithms used with JWE today.  It has one integrated algorithm - not two distinct ones for key establishment and content encryption.  I believe that supporting integrated encryption is a core goal of the work, and therefore the representation will necessarily differ from existing JWE representations in some respects.  I've come to believe, even as a JWE author, that this is OK.\n\nI'll note that any implementations that don't understand the \"HPKE-n\" algorithms or \"int\" will already do what you're supposed to do when you don't understand an algorithm.  They will return an error.\n\nWhereas implementations that do understand the \"HPKE-n\" algorithms and \"int\" will add new capabilities to their JWE implementations without breaking the existing capabilities.  I see that as a win.\n\nI believe the spec is already forthright about the fact that \"int\" is not an authenticated encryption algorithm and why it's being added to JWE.  If you'd like to suggest further language to be even clearer about this, have at it.",

Being clean design or easy to integrate to existing implementations comes only after the above two (and one can not expect to do well here).\n\nThe present design sure as heck is not clean, and I expect that integration with many existing implementations will be challenging at best. However, I think it does well with the first two priorities: \"int\" is not an AEAD, so it is invalid in base JWE, and the way it behaves is so different from anything else that it is extremely hard to handle as anything but a special case, which can then easily do the needed checks (which should be minimized).\n\nThat \"close to the least bad way\" comment was that I do not think there exists any significantly better design.

      "body": "https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jose/FLRcVbiMPd2NIV32Vlh8avE-gk4/\n...\n\nI have reviewed the -09 version and have many comments:\n\nIn the abstract:\n\n\"HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) function.\"\n\nI don\u2019t think this is true - there is an IANA registry of the specific combinations it works with. Even if we take it as \u201cin principle, it could\u201d I don\u2019t think that is true either - there are specific requirements on the components (eg IND-CCA2). I\u2019m not sure what the purpose is of this sentence, so I\u2019m not sure what alternative text would look like. Maybe \u201cHPKE is a general framework that supports several algorithms\u201d?\n\nThe abstract should probably also mention that only unauthenticated HPKE KEMs are supported.\n\nSection 4:\n\n\"When \"alg\" is a JOSE-HPKE algorithm\u201d - how do implementors determine if x is a JOSE-HPKE algorithm? Do they need to keep a list of these? Will they always start \u201cHPKE-\u201c?\n\nI find \u201cenc\u201d: \u201cinc\u201d to be problematic. It\u2019s not an AEAD, so violates the requirement in section 4.1.2 of RFC 7516:\n\n  \"This algorithm MUST be an AEAD algorithm with a specified key length.\u201d\n\nNeither of these requirements are satisfied by \u201cinc\u201d. \n\nOn a related note, what does {\u201calg\u201d: \u201cRSA-OAEP\u201d, \u201cenc\u201d: \u201cint\u201d} mean? If it is not allowed, then how is it prevented? Resolving these issues with the current design will need at least an update of 7516, but it really takes such a sledgehammer to the existing JWE specifications that I\u2019m not sure an update is enough.\n\nI\u2019m more and more convinced that Brian\u2019s suggestion to define a new JWHPKE would be a better solution than trying to crowbar this into JWE. (https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/jose/ssmlqF2lUGXwqnhD8SU7l2E1Aqg/)\n\n\"If \"enc\" is an AEAD algorithm [\u2026]\u201d - all \u201cenc\u201d values are supposed to be AEADs. Maybe this should say \u201cis not \u201cinc\u201d\u201d?\n\nThere seems to be a broken reference to RFC 9180 in the last sentence of this section.\n\nSection 4.1:\n\n\"HPKE algorithms are not required to process \"apu\" and \"apv\" as described in Section 4.6.1 of [RFC7518], despite appearing to be similar to key agreement algorithms (such as \"ECDH-ES\u201d).\u201d\n\nDoes \u201care not required to\u201d here actually mean \u201ccannot\u201d? I think this sentence needs rewording to more clearly say what is meant here. Maybe something like \u201cDespite appearing similar to ECDH-ES, JOSE-HPKE does not use the \u201capu\u201d and \u201capv\u201d headers.\u201d?\n\nI find the discussion of \u201caad\u201d in this section and the previous one extremely confusing. Section 4 says that compact serialization cannot use aad, but 4.1 says:\n\n\"The \"aad parameter\" for Open() and Seal() MUST be used with both HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption and HPKE JWE Key Encryption.\u201d\n\nwhich is it?\n\nThe next sentence about terminology should be moved to section 3 and then used consistently throughout the document, as it isn\u2019t currently.\n\nSection 5:\n\n\"JWE Initialization Vector and JWE Authentication Tag MUST NOT be present\u201d\n\nThese are mandatory fields, so perhaps this means to say \u201cMUST be an empty octet sequence\u201d?\n\nHow do the encryption steps in section 5.1 of RFC 7516 relate to HPKE encryption? I think quite a lot need to be skipped or changed?\n\nFor decryption, the draft says \"When decrypting, the checks in [RFC7516] section 5.2, steps 1 through 5 MUST be performed.\u201d - what about the steps 6\u201318? All of these steps are mandatory in JWE, how can you say this is a JOSE algorithm and then drive a coach and horses through most of the processing rules?\n\nSection 5.1:\n\nThis example is not a valid JWE Compact Serialization - it\u2019s missing a \u201c.\u201d somewhere.\n\nSection 5.2:\n\nThis example appears to be of the Key Encryption mode not the Integrated mode?\n\nIt would be extremely helpful to link to Appendix A in these examples, and to also consider a step-by-step description of how the examples were generated, as I think a lot is being left to implementors to figure out on their own.\n\nSection 6:\n\nThere is no \"RSA-OAEP-384\u201d algorithm - presumably \u201cRSA-OAEP-256\u201d is intended?\n\n\"The encoding of the protected header encoding remains consistent with existing JWE formatting rules.\u201d - one too many \u201cencoding\u201ds in this sentence, I think?\n\n\"The HPKE AAD parameter MUST be set to the empty string.\u201d - now I\u2019m completely confused about the AAD handling!\n\nSection 7:\n\nWhat is \u201cAKP\u201d key type - does it need a reference?\n\nSection 7.1:\n\nI find the use of \u201cencrypt\u201d for the \u201ckey_ops\u201d to be interesting. I would have expected maybe \u201cwrapKey\u201d? I don\u2019t think HPKE public keys are ever used to directly encrypt content? The draft should maybe clarify how key_ops relate to JOSE-HPKE operations?\n\nSection 8:\n\n\"In this case JOSE constructs like JWS and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can be used to add authentication.\u201d \n\nJWT is not a JOSE construct but rather an application of JOSE. I suggest removing the \u201cand JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)\u201d part completely.\n\nIt seems a bit strong that the approach of the Informational RFC 8937 is a \u201cMUST\u201d here. Are we really saying that CEKs MUST be generated as a pseudorandom function over a signature signed with the *recipient\u2019s private key*??? I don\u2019t see how this is even possible, let alone a hard requirement. Did you mean to link to eg RFC 4086 here instead (as JOSE already does)? (If it\u2019s really a MUST then it also needs to be a Normative Reference).\n\nSection 8.1:\n\n\"Additionally, the same key MUST NOT be used for both key encryption and integrated encryption, as it may introduce security risks. It creates algorithm confusion, increases the potential for key leakage, cross-suite attacks, and improper handling of the key.\u201d\n\nAre we sure all these risks are real? I\u2019m not really sure how using the same key for both key wrapping and integrated encryption leads to most of these things? Also, I\u2019m not really sure how you can prevent it - does this place a requirement on recipients to somehow communicate to all senders which mode to use? Should there be a new JWK field to communicate this?\n\nSections 8.2-8.6 seem like they could be replaced with a general recommendation to review RFC 8725.\n\nSection 9.2.8 - presumably the quotes are not needed around \u201cint\u201d? Can we also mention \u201cHPKE\u201d somewhere in the description?\n\nFor all of these registrations do we need a note to the RFC Editor to replace \u201cthis specification\u201d with the actual RFC when it\u2019s published?\n\nSection 9.3.1 - I\u2019m still not really clear why the existing JWE Encrypted Key is not sufficient here, but nevermind. This registration should mention that it is base64url-encoded.\n\n9.3.2 - a HPKE psk_id is an arbitrary byte string, so presumably this header is also base64url-encoded?\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this draft still needs a lot of work to be ready for publication.\n\n\u2014 Neil",

Consider implementation that supports JOSE-HPKE algorithms but does not special-case \"int\". In that case, it will always treat JOSE-HPKE as Key Encryption. However, JOSE-HPKE is designed so that Integrated Encryption and Key Encryption messages are incompatible, even with adversarial manipulation (and if \"int\" happens to be something weak on encryption side, that is critical vulnerability on that side).\n\nAnd on \"JWHPKE\", how to prevent it from getting confused with existing JOSE stuff?\n\nAnd on JWT being bad, I think the biggest mistake was wrapping it in generic signature layer.

Most of those changes are to align how Key Encryption works with the requirements in JWE. AAD construction for Key Encryption is also changed, the new construction should pose less implementation difficulties and addresses both cross-mode and oracle attacks, even if JOSE implementation omits mandatory checks. Finally, this also defines how keys (including AKP) work.\r\n\r\nNeeds a lot of wordsmithing (and I copied text from original that I think needs editorial improvement).\r\n",

So I would presume that use is meant to be useful for more fine-grained scoping as well.\r\n\r\nThe HPKE sender role keys are not used for encryption, those are used for authentication (this is not a counterexample to previous, because there is a major extension involved). Using the same key for encryption and authentication is not a good practice (even if it probably is ultimately safe).\r\n\r\nAnd using the same key with multiple mechanisms (e.g. the JOSE ECDH-ES and HPKE) is not a good practice either, even if it almost invariably ends up being safe.\r\n",

For example, a malicious recipient could decrypt the CEK, modify the decrypted message, and re-encrypt it using the same CEK.

Good luck getting past that.)\r\n\r\nIn fact, only AEAD algorithms are registered at [JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml#web-signature-encryption-algorithms) as `enc` values, and non-AEAD algorithms are not permitted to be registered.  Thus, there are no algorithm identifiers for non-AEAD algorithms.\r\n\r\nAn implementation would have to knowingly violate the spec *and* create non-standard algorithm identifiers to use non-AEAD algorithms.

I don't recall the exact wording but it was something like \"unacceptable\" or \"unwilling\" or just didn't want to and wouldn't. Maybe I misunderstood but the message seemed pretty clear to me at the time - that was that this was not something that would be done or considered for JOSE HPKE. So my confusion and question was about what seemed to me to be statements and actions that were contradictory. I guess I was just trying to understand if opinions had changed or been overruled amongst the editors or what else may have transpired or changed. Or if I've misunderstood. ",

Application information applicable to multiple operations on a single Context should use the Setup info parameter. This avoids redundantly processing this information for each Context operation. In contrast, application information that varies on a per-message basis should be specified via the Context APIs (Seal(), Open(), or Export()).\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n> Application information applicable to multiple operations on a single Context should use the Setup info parameter.\r\n\r\nThis is IMO not true of recipient info structure... because the recipient info is used once, to encrypt the aead key to the recipient.\r\n\r\nThat said, if folks want to use info for each recipient and not use aad for each recipient, its possible there are good security reasons to do this, that are unrelated to how many times you use info.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, the only value of the info parameter for JOSE over what we get from the info parameters used in base HPKE is to separate content encryption keys used with JOSE from other keys... if we want it to also separate keys used for specific AEADs with JOSE, we can accomplish that with string concatenation:\r\n\r\nJOSE_HPKE_Recipient_Info = \"JOSE_HPKE\" + \".\" + JWE_AEAD_ALG + \".\" + EXTRA_JOSE_HPKE_RECIPIENT_INFO\r\n",

The word \"downgrade\" only even appears in RFC9709 in the title of an informative reference (which I think is to the pdf of the slides introducing what would become known as the \"lamps attack\" and is about a downgrade from AEAD to non-AEAD).  Remember that JWE doesn't allow non-AEAD content encryption. \n\nA reference and statement like this is, at best, confusing or distracting. And, at less than best, it's potentially misleading or alarmist.  \n\nIf there's something relevant, then maybe it could be briefly summarized or pointed to more directly? And framed appropriately. \n\nI don't want to derail this PR because it's a major improvement. But it does need to be fixed. \n\n\n\n",

Instead of fitting into the existing modes, a new properly defined mode can make do without an awkward value like \"int\" in \"enc\".\r\n\r\nAn update to https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516#section-4.1.2 giving an exemption to \"This Header Parameter MUST be present and MUST be understood and processed by implementations.\" would be needed tho.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7516#section-9 lists a number of ways to distinguish JWE from JWS, from my experience the first and second are wildly used for that purpose, the latter are not. the last one which then expects \"enc\" would need massaging/removal.",

JWE allows putting the \"enc\" parameter in weird places, so implementations would have to assemble the JOSE Header to determine the mode, as opposed to checking if JWE Protected Header has enc=int and branching to IE case. Enc=int elsewhere is not allowed and not recognizing it is not a problem, as decryption will fail safe.",

Receiver has legitimate reason to remove weak algorithms (e.g, RSA in this case) but that does not come into play as the message can be decrypted without any weak algorithms.\r\n\r\nThen the recipients are not authenticated (unless the whole message is signed), so a MITM attacker can hide the weak recipients by dropping those from the message.\r\n\r\nIOW, it was sender including the RSA recipient that compromised the message, not receiver decrypting the message with RSA recipient.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the opposite of signatures, where it is receiver that is at fault for accepting weak signatures, and thus RSA signatures should not be accepted after Q day (unless the signature algorithm is so bad that it actually compromises the key). Even then, mere presence of weak algorithm is not grounds for rejection (unless it is none, as that gives signature error if implemented properly).\r\n\r\n> Perhaps we can reframe this in terms of known algorithms that are not considered strong enough to secure the CEK?\r\n\r\nThe crypto policy enforcement for encryption is on sender, not receiver. It is critical for security, so counts as critical vulnerability if broken. And what that policy is very much depends on environment and possibly even the message.\r\n",

Then generate a random CEK and then conditional-overwrite the resulting CEK with that if CEK conflict flag is set.\r\n\r\n(For an implementation that does not support \"RSA1_5\" or similar problems, immediately aborting, using the first CEK, using the last CEK or using random CEK are all fine.
