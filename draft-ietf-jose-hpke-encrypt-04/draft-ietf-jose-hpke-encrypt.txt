Use of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) with JSON Object Signing and
                           Encryption (JOSE)
                  draft-ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) for
   use with JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE).  HPKE offers a
   variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a
   recipient public key.

   HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric key encapsulation
   mechanism (KEM), key derivation function (KDF), and authenticated
   encryption with additional data (AEAD) function.  Authentication for
   HPKE in JOSE is provided by JOSE-native security mechanisms or by one
   of the authenticated variants of HPKE.

   This document defines the use of the HPKE with JOSE.

1.  Introduction

   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) [RFC9180] is a scheme that
   provides public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts given a
   recipient's public key.

   This specification enables JSON Web Encryption (JWE) to leverage
   HPKE, bringing support for KEMs and the possibility of Post Quantum
   or Hybrid KEMs to JWE.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conventions and Terminology

   This specification uses the following abbreviations and terms:

   *  Content Encryption Key (CEK), is defined in [RFC7517].

   *  Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined in [RFC9180].

   *  pkR is the public key of the recipient, as defined in [RFC9180].

   *  skR is the private key of the recipient, as defined in [RFC9180].

   *  Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), see [RFC9180].

   *  Key Derivation Function (KDF), see [RFC9180].

   *  Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), see
      [RFC9180].

   *  Additional Authenticated Data (AAD), see [RFC9180].

4.  Overview

   This specification describes two modes of use for HPKE in JWE:

   *  HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption, where HPKE is used to encrypt the
      plaintext.

   *  HPKE JWE Key Encryption, where HPKE is used to encrypt a content
      encryption key (CEK) and the CEK is subsequently used to encrypt
      the plaintext.

   When "alg" and "enc" are both present in a protected header and when
   "iv" and "tag" are empty, the mode is HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption.

   When "enc" is present in a protected header and "alg" is absent, the
   mode is HPKE JWE Key Encryption when a valid HPKE "alg" value is
   present in the unprotected headers.

   HPKE supports several modes, which are described in Table 1 of
   [RFC9180].

   In JWE, the use of specific HPKE modes such as "mode_base" or
   "mode_auth_psk" is determined by the presence of the header
   parameters "psk_id" and "auth_kid".

   JWE supports different serializations, including Compact JWE
   Serialization as described in Section 3.1 of [RFC7516], General JWE
   JSON Serialization as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC7516].

   Certain JWE features are only supported in specific serializations.

   For example Compact JWE Serialization does not support the following:

   *  additional authenticated data

   *  multiple recipients

   *  unprotected headers

   HPKE JWE Key Encryption can be used with "aad" but only when not
   expressed with Compact JWE Serialization.

   Single recipient HPKE JWE Key Encryption with no "aad" can be
   expressed in Compact JWE Serialization, so long as the recipient and
   sender use the same HPKE Setup process as described in { Section 5 of
   RFC9180 }.

4.1.  Auxiliary Authenticated Application Information

   HPKE has two places at which applications can specify auxiliary
   authenticated information as described in { Section 8.1 of RFC9180 }.

   HPKE algorithms are not required to process "apu" and "apv" as
   described in Section 4.6.1 of [RFC7518], despite appearing to be
   similar to key agreement algorithms (such as "ECDH-ES").

   The "aad parameter" for Open() and Seal() MUST be used with both HPKE
   JWE Integrated Encryption and HPKE JWE Key Encryption.

   To avoid confusion between JWE AAD and HPKE AAD, this document uses
   the term "HPKE AEAD AAD" to refer the "aad parameter" for Open() and
   Seal().

   The HPKE AEAD AAD MUST be set to the "JWE Additional Authenticated
   Data encryption parameter" defined in Step 14 of Section 5.1 of
   [RFC7516] which is repeated here for clarity:

   Let the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be
   ASCII(Encoded Protected Header).  However, if a JWE AAD value is
   present (which can only be the case when using the JWE JSON
   Serialization), instead let the Additional Authenticated Data
   encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header || '.' ||
   BASE64URL(JWE AAD)).

4.2.  Encapsulated Keys

   Encapsulated keys MUST be the base64url encoded encapsulated key as
   defined in Section 5.1.1 of [RFC9180].

   In HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption, JWE Encrypted Key is the
   encapsulated key.

   In HPKE JWE Key Encryption, each recipient JWE Encrypted Key is the
   encrypted content encryption key, and the encapsulated key (ek) is
   found in the recipient header.

5.  Integrated Encryption

   In HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption:

   *  The protected header MUST contain an "alg" that starts with
      "HPKE".

   *  The protected header MUST contain an "enc" and it MUST be set to
      the value "dir".  It updates Section 4.1.2 of [RFC7516] to clarify
      that in case where HPKE JWE Integrated Encryption is used, setting
      "enc" set to "dir" is appropriate, as both the derivation of the
      CEK and the encryption of the plaintext are fully handled within
      the HPKE encryption.

   *  The protected header parameters "psk_id" and "auth_kid" MAY be
      present.

   *  The protected header parameter "ek" MUST NOT be present.

   *  The "encrypted_key" MUST be the base64url encoded encapsulated key
      as defined in Section 5.1.1 of [RFC9180].

   *  The "iv", "tag" and "aad" members MUST NOT be present.

   *  The "ciphertext" MUST be the base64url encoded ciphertext as
      defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC9180].

   *  The HPKE Setup info parameter MAY be used, and its values are not
      constrained by this specification.  By default, it is empty unless
      apu or apv are present, in which case it will carry the JOSE
      context-specific data as defined in Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518],
      i.e., the concatenation of AlgorithmID, PartyUInfo, and
      PartyVInfo.  It does not include Z, keydatalen, SuppPubInfo, or
      SuppPrivInfo.  AlgorithmID is structured as defined in
      Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518] and the Data field in AlgorithmID will
      be set to the octets of the ASCII representation of the "enc"
      Header Parameter value.

  },
  "plaintext": "🖤 this plaintext!",
  "additionalAuthenticatedData": "🏴‍☠️ beware the aad!"
}

6.  Key Encryption

   HPKE based recipients can be added alongside existing ECDH-ES+A128KW
   or RSA-OAEP-384 recipients because HPKE is only used to encrypt the
   content encryption key, and because the protected header used in
   content encryption is passed to HPKE as Additional Authenticated
   Data.

   In HPKE JWE Key Encryption:

   *  The protected header MUST NOT contain an "alg".

   *  The protected header MUST contain an "enc" that is registered in
      both the IANA HPKE AEAD Identifiers Registry, and the IANA JSON
      Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms Registry.

   *  The recipient unprotected header parameters "psk_id" and
      "auth_kid" MAY be present.

   *  The recipient unprotected header parameter "ek" MUST be present.

   *  The recipient unprotected header MUST contain a registered HPKE
      "alg" value.

   *  The "encrypted_key" MUST be the base64url encoded content
      encryption key as described in Step 15 in Section 5.1 of
      [RFC7516].

   *  The recipient "encrypted_key" is as described in Section 7.2.1 of
      [RFC7516].

   *  The "iv", "tag" JWE members MUST be present.

   *  The "aad" JWE member MAY be present.

   *  The "ciphertext" MUST be the base64url encoded ciphertext as
      described in Step 19 in Section 5.1 of [RFC7516].

   *  The HPKE Setup info parameter MAY be used, and its values are not
      constrained by this specification.  By default, it is empty unless
      apu or apv are present, in which case it will carry the JOSE
      context-specific data as defined in Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518],
      i.e., the concatenation of AlgorithmID, PartyUInfo, and
      PartyVInfo.  It does not include Z, keydatalen, SuppPubInfo, or
      SuppPrivInfo.  AlgorithmID is structured as defined in
      Section 4.6.2 of [RFC7518] and the Data field in AlgorithmID will
      be set to the octets of the ASCII representation of the "alg"
      (algorithm) Header Parameter value.

6.1.  Multiple Recipients

  },

}

7.  Security Considerations

   This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations
   of [RFC9180] are therefore applicable also to this specification.

   HPKE assumes the sender is in possession of the public key of the
   recipient and HPKE JOSE makes the same assumptions.  Hence, some form
   of public key distribution mechanism is assumed to exist but outside
   the scope of this document.

   HPKE in Base mode does not offer authentication as part of the HPKE
   KEM.  In this case JOSE constructs like JWS and JSON Web Tokens
   (JWTs) can be used to add authentication.  HPKE also offers modes
   that offer authentication.

   HPKE relies on a source of randomness to be available on the device.
   In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, CEK has to be randomly
   generated and it MUST be ensured that the guidelines in [RFC8937] for
   random number generations are followed.

7.1.  Key Management

   Reusing a single KEM key across multiple algorithm combinations MUST
   be avoided to maintain cryptographic security.  Each key and its
   associated algorithm suite, comprising the KEM, KDF, and AEAD, should
   be managed independently.  This separation prevents unintended
   interactions or vulnerabilities between suites, ensuring the
   integrity and security guarantees of each algorithm suite are
   preserved.  Additionally, the same key MUST NOT be used for both key
   wrapping and content encryption, as it may introduce security risks.
   It creates algorithm confusion, increases the potential for key
   leakage, cross-suite attacks, and improper handling of the key.

7.2.  Plaintext Compression

   Implementers are advised to review Section 3.6 of [RFC8725], which
   states: Compression of data SHOULD NOT be done before encryption,
   because such compressed data often reveals information about the
   plaintext.

7.3.  Header Parameters

   Implementers are advised to review Section 3.10 of [RFC8725], which
   comments on application processing of JWE Protected Headers.
   Additionally, Unprotected Headers can contain similar information
   which an attacker could leverage to mount denial of service, forgery
   or injection attacks.

7.4.  Ensure Cryptographic Keys Have Sufficient Entropy

   Implementers are advised to review Section 3.5 of [RFC8725], which
   provides comments on entropy requirements for keys.  This guidance is
   relevant to both public and private keys used in both Key Encryption
   and Integrated Encryption.  Additionally, this guidance is applicable
   to content encryption keys used in Key Encryption mode.

7.5.  Validate Cryptographic Inputs

   Implementers are advised to review Section 3.4 of [RFC8725], which
   provides comments on the validation of cryptographic inputs.  This
   guidance is relevant to both public and private keys used in both Key
   Encryption and Integrated Encryption, specifically focusing on the
   structure of the public and private keys.  These inputs are crucial
   for the HPKE KEM operations.

7.6.  Use Appropriate Algorithms

   Implementers are advised to review Section 3.2 of [RFC8725], which
   comments on the selection of appropriate algorithms.  This is
   guidance is relevant to both Key Encryption and Integrated
   Encryption.  When using Key Encryption, the strength of the content
   encryption algorithm should not be significantly different from the
   strengh of the Key Encryption algorithms used.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document adds entries to [JOSE-IANA].

8.1.  Ciphersuite Registration

   This specification registers a number of ciphersuites for use with
   HPKE.  A ciphersuite is a group of algorithms, often sharing
   component algorithms such as hash functions, targeting a security
   level.  An HPKE ciphersuite, is composed of the following choices:

   *  HPKE Mode

   *  KEM Algorithm

   *  KDF Algorithm

   *  AEAD Algorithm

   The "KEM", "KDF", and "AEAD" values are chosen from the HPKE IANA
   registry [HPKE-IANA].

   For readability the algorithm ciphersuites labels are built according
   to the following scheme:

   HPKE-<KEM>-<KDF>-<AEAD>

   The "HPKE Mode" is described in Table 1 of [RFC9180]:

   *  "Base" refers to "mode_base" described in Section 5.1.1 of
      [RFC9180], which only enables encryption to the holder of a given
      KEM private key.

   *  "PSK" refers to "mode_psk", described in Section 5.1.2 of
      [RFC9180], which authenticates using a pre-shared key.

   *  "Auth" refers to "mode_auth", described in Section 5.1.3 of
      [RFC9180], which authenticates using an asymmetric key.

   *  "Auth_Psk" refers to "mode_auth_psk", described in Section 5.1.4
      of [RFC9180], which authenticates using both a PSK and an
      asymmetric key.
