Use of Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) with JSON Object Signing and
                           Encryption (JOSE)
                  draft-ietf-jose-hpke-encrypt-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) for
   use with JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE).  HPKE offers a
   variant of public key encryption of arbitrary-sized plaintexts for a
   recipient public key, and provides security against adaptive chosen
   ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2-secure).

   HPKE also includes a variant that authenticates possession of a pre-
   shared key.  HPKE works for any combination of an asymmetric KEM, key
   derivation function (KDF), and authenticated encryption with
   additional data (AEAD) encryption function.

   This document defines the use of HPKE with JOSE.  The specification
   chooses a specific subset of the HPKE features to use with JOSE.

1.  Introduction

   Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke] is a public
   key encryption (PKE) scheme that provides encryption of arbitrary-
   sized plaintexts given a recipient's public key.  This specification
   enables JSON Web Encryption (JWE) [RFC7516] to leverage HPKE,
   bringing support for HPKE encryption and KEMs to JWE, and the
   possibility of utilizing future HPKE algorithms, including hybrid
   KEMs.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology

   This specification uses the following abbreviations and terms:

   *  Content Encryption Key (CEK), is defined in [RFC7516].

   *  Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  pkR is the public key of the recipient, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  skR is the private key of the recipient, as defined in
      [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), see [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  Key Derivation Function (KDF), see [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), see
      [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke] and [RFC7516].

   *  Additional Authenticated Data (AAD), see [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke] and
      [RFC7516].

   This specification defines the following terms.  When the term is
   already defined in JWE [RFC7516], the definition below replaces it.

   Key Management Mode  A method of determining the Content Encryption
      Key (CEK) value to use and whether the encryption uses a CEK.  Key
      Management Modes employed by this specification are Key
      Encryption, Key Wrapping, Direct Key Agreement, Key Agreement with
      Key Wrapping, Direct Encryption, HPKE Integrated Encryption, and
      HPKE Key Encryption.

   HPKE Integrated Encryption  A Key Management Mode in which HPKE is
      used to directly encrypt the plaintext without the use of a
      Content Encryption Key (CEK)

   HPKE Key Encryption  A Key Management Mode in which HPKE is used to
      encrypt the Content Encryption Key (CEK)

4.  Overview

   This specification defines two new Key Management Modes for use with
   JWE:

   *  HPKE Integrated Encryption, in which HPKE is used to directly
      encrypt the plaintext without the use of a Content Encryption Key
      (CEK).

   *  HPKE Key Encryption, in which HPKE is used to encrypt the Content
      Encryption Key (CEK).

   When "alg" is a JOSE-HPKE algorithm:

   *  If "enc" is "int", HPKE Integrated Encryption is used.

   *  If "enc" is an AEAD algorithm, the recipient Key Management mode
      is Key Encryption.

   The HPKE key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), key derivation function
   (KDF), and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD)
   encryption function utilized depend on the JOSE-HPKE algorithm used.
   The HPKE AEAD encryption function is used internally by HPKE and is
   distinct from the JWE AEAD algorithm specified in "enc".

   HPKE supports multiple modes, which are described in Table 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].  In this specification, both "mode_base" and
   "mode_psk" are utilized.  When the "psk_id" JOSE Header parameter is
   present, the mode used is "mode_psk"; otherwise, the mode used is
   "mode_base".  (This specification does not use the "mode_auth" or
   "mode_auth_psk" HPKE modes.)

   JWE supports both the JWE Compact Serialization, as described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC7516], and the JWE JSON Serialization, as
   described in Section 3.2 of [RFC7516].  Certain JWE features are only
   supported in specific serializations.

   For example, the Compact JWE Serialization does not support:

   *  additional authenticated data

   *  multiple recipients

   *  unprotected headers

   HPKE Key Encryption can be used with "aad" but only when not
   expressed with Compact JWE Serialization.

   Single recipient HPKE Key Encryption with no "aad" can be expressed
   in Compact JWE Serialization, so long as the recipient and sender use
   the same HPKE Setup process as described in Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   This specification updates the "enc" definition in Section 4.1.2 of
   [RFC7516] by allowing the "enc" value "int" when the "alg" value is a
   JOSE-HPKE algorithm.  When "alg" is not a JOSE-HPKE algorithm and the
   "enc" value is "int", the input MUST NOT be used and MUST be
   rejected.

4.1.  Auxiliary Authenticated Application Information

   The HPKE "aad parameter" for Open() and Seal() specified in
   Section 8.1 of [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke] is used with both HPKE Integrated
   Encryption and HPKE Key Encryption.  Its value is the Additional
   Authenticated Data encryption parameter value computed in Step 14 of
   Section 5.1 of [RFC7516] (Message Encryption).

4.2.  Encapsulated Keys

   HPKE encapsulated key is defined in Section 5 of
   [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   In HPKE Integrated Encryption, the JWE Encrypted Key of the sole
   recipient is the HPKE encapsulated key.

   In HPKE Key Encryption, each recipient's JWE Encrypted Key is the
   encrypted content encryption key, and the value of JOSE Header
   parameter "ek" is the base64url encoding of the HPKE encapsulated
   key.

5.  Integrated Encryption

   When using HPKE Integrated Encryption:

   *  The protected header MUST contain an "alg" that is JOSE-HPKE
      algorithm.

   *  The protected header MUST contain an "enc" with value "int".  This
      is an explicit exception to requirement in Section 4.1.2 of
      [RFC7516] that "enc" must be an AEAD algorithm.  This is
      appropriate, as HPKE will perform plaintext encryption.

   *  The protected header parameter "psk_id" MAY be present.

   *  The protected header parameter "ek" MUST NOT be present.

   *  There MUST be exactly one recipient.

   *  The JWE Encrypted Key MUST be the encapsulated key, as defined in
      Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  The JWE Initialization Vector and JWE Authentication Tag MUST be
      the empty octet sequence.

   *  The JWE AAD MAY be present when using the JWE JSON Serialization.

   *  The JWE Ciphertext is the ciphertext defined in Section 5.2 of
      [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke].

   *  The HPKE info parameter contains the encoding of the
      Recipient_structure, which is described in Section 7.

   *  The HPKE aad parameter MUST be set to the "Additional
      Authenticated Data encryption parameter", as specified in Step 14
      of Section 5.1 of [RFC7516].

   *  Then follow Steps 11-19 of Section 5.1 of [RFC7516] (Message
      Encryption).

   When decrypting, the checks in Section 5.2 of [RFC7516], Steps 1
   through 5 MUST be performed.  The JWE Encrypted Key in Step 2 is the
   base64url-encoded encapsulated key.

5.1.  Compact Example

   Below is an example of a Compact JWE using HPKE integrated
   encryption:

   =============== NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792 ================

   eyJhbGciOiAiSFBLRS0wIiwgImVuYyI6ICJpbnQiLCAia2lkIjogIkc1Tl9fQ3FNdl9r\

                                       llz6VUyiw8nZL0OPGLGZckLTm5UcTZFg.

   The keys used for this example are in Appendix A.

6.  Key Encryption

   When using the JWE JSON Serialization, recipients using JOSE-HPKE can
   be added alongside other recipients (e.g., those using ECDH-ES+A128KW
   or RSA-OAEP-256), since HPKE is used to encrypt the Content
   Encryption Key, which is then processed as specified in JWE.

   The encoding of the protected header remains consistent with existing
   JWE rules.

   When using HPKE Key Encryption:

   *  The Key Management Mode is Key Encryption.

   *  When all recipients use the same HPKE algorithm to secure the
      Content Encryption Key, the JWE Protected Header SHOULD contain
      "alg".  Otherwise, the JWE Protected Header (and JWE Shared
      Unprotected Header) MUST NOT contain "alg".

   *  JOSE Header parameter "alg" MUST be a JOSE-HPKE algorithm.

   *  JOSE Header parameter "psk_id" MAY be present.

   *  JOSE Header parameter "ek" MUST be present and contain the
      base64url-encoded HPKE encapsulated key.

   *  Recipient JWE Encrypted Key MUST be the ciphertext from HPKE
      Encryption.

   *  The HPKE info parameter contains the encoding of the
      Recipient_structure, which is described in Section 7.

   *  The HPKE AAD parameter defaults to the empty string; externally
      provided information MAY be used instead.

   *  THE HPKE plaintext MUST be set to the CEK.

   The processing of "enc", "iv", "tag", "aad", and "ciphertext" is as
   already defined in [RFC7516].  Implementations process these
   parameters as defined in [RFC7516]; no additional processing
   requirements are introduced by HPKE-based key encryption.

6.1.  JSON Example

   Below is an example of a JWE using the JSON Serialization and HPKE
   key encryption:

   =============== NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792 ================

   {
     "protected": "eyJlbmMiOiAiQTEyOEdDTSJ9",
     "ciphertext": "9AxOd65ROJY1cQ",
     "iv": "2u3NRi3CSr-x7Wuj",
     "tag": "1NKYSWVV4pw5thsq7t6m6Q",
     "recipients": [
       {
         "encrypted_key": "l9VRW1K5CA037fY2ZqVF4bDej413TaAtfjoe3k89-eI",
         "header": {
           "alg": "HPKE-0",
           "kid": "G5N__CqMv_kJGieGSFuAugvl0jrQJCZ3yKwVK6sUM4o",
           "ek": "BJl0V6KLl3HOAZbzFwiAL9eaYbFQPg7-\
                ROmIJpluIQjNS5zultZsC4rGhGzmW1GUWG8bzJUWLQtxFF9oze0AKhU"
         }
       }
     ]
   }

   The keys used for this example are in Appendix A.

7.  Recipient_structure

   The Recipient_structure is an input to the HPKE info parameter and
   provides context information used in key derivation.  To ensure
   compactness and interoperability, this structure is encoded in a
   binary format.  The encoding is as follows:

   Recipient_structure = ASCII("JOSE-HPKE rcpt") ||
                         BYTE(255) ||
                         ASCII(content_encryption_alg) ||
                         BYTE(255) ||
                         recipient_extra_info

   Where:

   *  ASCII("JOSE-HPKE rcpt"): A fixed ASCII string identifying the
      context of the structure.

   *  BYTE(255): A separator byte (0xFF) used to delimit fields.

   *  ASCII(content_encryption_alg): Identifies the algorithm with which
      the HPKE-encrypted key MUST be used.  Its value MUST match the
      "enc" (encryption algorithm) header parameter in the JOSE Header.
      This field provides JWE context information to the key derivation
      process and serves two purposes:

      1.  Ensures that derived key material is cryptographically domain-
          separated between the JWE HPKE integrated encryption and Key
          Encryption modes.

      2.  Ensures that the derived key is bound to the selected content
          encryption algorithm.

   *  BYTE(255): A separator byte (0xFF) used to delimit fields.

   *  recipient_extra_info: An octet string containing additional
      context information that the application includes in the key
      derivation via the HPKE info parameter.  Mutually known private
      information (a concept also utilized in [NIST.SP.800-56Ar3]) MAY
      be used in this input parameter.  If no additional context
      information is provided, this field MUST be empty.

7.1.  Recipient_structure Example

   The Recipient_structure encoded in binary as specified in Section 7,
   and using the field values (next_layer_alg = "A128GCM",
   recipient_extra_info = ""), results in the following byte sequence:

   "JOSE-HPKE rcpt\xffA128GCM\xff"

   The corresponding hexadecimal representation is:

   4a4f53452d48504b452072637074ffa131323847434dff

   This value is directly used as the HPKE info parameter.

8.  Producing and Consuming JWEs

   Sections 5.1 (Message Encryption) and 5.2 (Message Decryption) of
   [RFC7516] are replaced by the following descriptions, which add
   processing rules for the HPKE Integrated Encryption and HPKE Key
   Encryption Key Management Modes.

8.1.  Message Encryption

   The message encryption process is as follows.  The order of the steps
   is not significant in cases where there are no dependencies between
   the inputs and outputs of the steps.

   1.   Determine the Key Management Mode employed by the algorithm used
        to determine the Content Encryption Key value.  (This is the
        algorithm recorded in the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter of
        the resulting JWE.)

   2.   When Key Wrapping, Key Encryption, or Key Agreement with Key
        Wrapping are employed, generate a random CEK value.  See
        [RFC4086] for considerations on generating random values.  The
        CEK MUST have a length equal to that required for the content
        encryption algorithm.

   3.   When Direct Key Agreement or Key Agreement with Key Wrapping are
        employed, use the key agreement algorithm to compute the value
        of the agreed upon key.  When Direct Key Agreement is employed,
        let the CEK be the agreed upon key.  When Key Agreement with Key
        Wrapping is employed, the agreed upon key will be used to wrap
        the CEK.

   4.   When Key Wrapping, Key Encryption, or Key Agreement with Key
        Wrapping are employed, encrypt the CEK to the recipient and let
        the result be the JWE Encrypted Key.

   5.   When Direct Key Agreement or Direct Encryption are employed, let
        the JWE Encrypted Key be the empty octet sequence.

   6.   When Direct Encryption is employed, let the CEK be the shared
        symmetric key.

   7.   Compute the encoded key value BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key).

   8.   If the JWE JSON Serialization is being used, repeat this process
        (steps 1-7) for each recipient.

   9.   Generate a random JWE Initialization Vector of the correct size
        for the content encryption algorithm (if required for the
        algorithm); otherwise, let the JWE Initialization Vector be the
        empty octet sequence.

   10.  Compute the encoded Initialization Vector value BASE64URL(JWE
        Initialization Vector).

   11.  If a zip parameter was included, compress the plaintext using
        the specified compression algorithm and let M be the octet
        sequence representing the compressed plaintext; otherwise, let M
        be the octet sequence representing the plaintext.

   12.  Create the JSON object(s) containing the desired set of Header
        Parameters, which together comprise the JOSE Header: one or more
        of the JWE Protected Header, the JWE Shared Unprotected Header,
        and the JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected Header.

   13.  Compute the Encoded Protected Header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE
        Protected Header)).  If the JWE Protected Header is not present
        (which can only happen when using the JWE JSON Serialization and
        no protected member is present), let this value be the empty
        string.

   14.  Let the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be
        ASCII(Encoded Protected Header).  However, if a JWE AAD value is
        present (which can only be the case when using the JWE JSON
        Serialization), instead let the Additional Authenticated Data
        encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header || '.' ||
        BASE64URL(JWE AAD)).

   15.  Encrypt M using the CEK, the JWE Initialization Vector, and the
        Additional Authenticated Data value using the specified content
        encryption algorithm to create the JWE Ciphertext value and the
        JWE Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag output
        from the encryption operation).

   16.  Compute the encoded ciphertext value BASE64URL(JWE Ciphertext).

   17.  Compute the encoded Authentication Tag value BASE64URL(JWE
        Authentication Tag).

   18.  If a JWE AAD value is present, compute the encoded AAD value
        BASE64URL(JWE AAD).

   19.  Create the desired serialized output.  The Compact Serialization
        of this result is the string BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE Protected
        Header)) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWE Encrypted Key) || '.' ||
        BASE64URL(JWE Initialization Vector) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWE
        Ciphertext) || '.' || BASE64URL(JWE Authentication Tag).  The
        JWE JSON Serialization is described in Section 7.2 of [RFC7516].

8.2.  Message Decryption

   The message decryption process is the reverse of the encryption
   process.  The order of the steps is not significant in cases where
   there are no dependencies between the inputs and outputs of the
   steps.  If any of these steps fail, the encrypted content cannot be
   validated.

   When there are multiple recipients, it is an application decision
   which of the recipients' encrypted content must successfully validate
   for the JWE to be accepted.  In some cases, encrypted content for all
   recipients must successfully validate or the JWE will be considered
   invalid.  In other cases, only the encrypted content for a single
   recipient needs to be successfully validated.  However, in all cases,
   the encrypted content for at least one recipient MUST successfully
   validate or the JWE MUST be considered invalid.

   1.   Parse the JWE representation to extract the serialized values
        for the components of the JWE.  When using the JWE Compact
        Serialization, these components are the base64url-encoded
        representations of the JWE Protected Header, the JWE Encrypted
        Key, the JWE Initialization Vector, the JWE Ciphertext, and the
        JWE Authentication Tag, and when using the JWE JSON
        Serialization, these components also include the base64url-
        encoded representation of the JWE AAD and the unencoded JWE
        Shared Unprotected Header and JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected
        Header values.  When using the JWE Compact Serialization, the
        JWE Protected Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE
        Initialization Vector, the JWE Ciphertext, and the JWE
        Authentication Tag are represented as base64url-encoded values
        in that order, with each value being separated from the next by
        a single period ('.') character, resulting in exactly four
        delimiting period characters being used.  The JWE JSON
        Serialization is described in Section 7.2 of [RFC7516].

   2.   Base64url decode the encoded representations of the JWE
        Protected Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, the JWE Initialization
        Vector, the JWE Ciphertext, the JWE Authentication Tag, and the
        JWE AAD, following the restriction that no line breaks,
        whitespace, or other additional characters have been used.

   3.   Verify that the octet sequence resulting from decoding the
        encoded JWE Protected Header is a UTF-8-encoded representation
        of a completely valid JSON object conforming to [RFC8259]; let
        the JWE Protected Header be this JSON object.

   4.   If using the JWE Compact Serialization, let the JOSE Header be
        the JWE Protected Header.  Otherwise, when using the JWE JSON
        Serialization, let the JOSE Header be the union of the members
        of the JWE Protected Header, the JWE Shared Unprotected Header
        and the corresponding JWE Per-Recipient Unprotected Header, all
        of which must be completely valid JSON objects.  During this
        step, verify that the resulting JOSE Header does not contain
        duplicate Header Parameter names.  When using the JWE JSON
        Serialization, this restriction includes that the same Header
        Parameter name also MUST NOT occur in distinct JSON object
        values that together comprise the JOSE Header.

   5.   Verify that the implementation understands and can process all
        fields that it is required to support, whether required by this
        specification, by the algorithms being used, or by the crit
        Header Parameter value, and that the values of those parameters
        are also understood and supported.

   6.   Determine the Key Management Mode employed by the algorithm
        specified by the alg (algorithm) Header Parameter.

   7.   Verify that the JWE uses a key known to the recipient.

   8.   When Direct Key Agreement or Key Agreement with Key Wrapping are
        employed, use the key agreement algorithm to compute the value
        of the agreed upon key.  When Direct Key Agreement is employed,
        let the CEK be the agreed upon key.  When Key Agreement with Key
        Wrapping is employed, the agreed upon key will be used to
        decrypt the JWE Encrypted Key.

   9.   When Key Wrapping, Key Encryption, or Key Agreement with Key
        Wrapping are employed, decrypt the JWE Encrypted Key to produce
        the CEK.  The CEK MUST have a length equal to that required for
        the content encryption algorithm.  Note that when there are
        multiple recipients, each recipient will only be able to decrypt
        JWE Encrypted Key values that were encrypted to a key in that
        recipient's possession.  It is therefore normal to only be able
        to decrypt one of the per-recipient JWE Encrypted Key values to
        obtain the CEK value.  Also, see Section 11.5 of [RFC7516] for
        security considerations on mitigating timing attacks.

   10.  When Direct Key Agreement or Direct Encryption are employed,
        verify that the JWE Encrypted Key value is an empty octet
        sequence.

   11.  When Direct Encryption is employed, let the CEK be the shared
        symmetric key.

   12.  Record whether the CEK could be successfully determined for this
        recipient or not.

   13.  If the JWE JSON Serialization is being used, repeat this process
        (steps 4-12) for each recipient contained in the representation.

   14.  Compute the Encoded Protected Header value BASE64URL(UTF8(JWE
        Protected Header)).  If the JWE Protected Header is not present
        (which can only happen when using the JWE JSON Serialization and
        no protected member is present), let this value be the empty
        string.

   15.  Let the Additional Authenticated Data encryption parameter be
        ASCII(Encoded Protected Header).  However, if a JWE AAD value is
        present (which can only be the case when using the JWE JSON
        Serialization), instead let the Additional Authenticated Data
        encryption parameter be ASCII(Encoded Protected Header || '.' ||
        BASE64URL(JWE AAD)).

   16.  Decrypt the JWE Ciphertext using the CEK, the JWE Initialization
        Vector, the Additional Authenticated Data value, and the JWE
        Authentication Tag (which is the Authentication Tag input to the
        calculation) using the specified content encryption algorithm,
        returning the decrypted plaintext and validating the JWE
        Authentication Tag in the manner specified for the algorithm,
        rejecting the input without emitting any decrypted output if the
        JWE Authentication Tag is incorrect.

   17.  If a zip parameter was included, uncompress the decrypted
        plaintext using the specified compression algorithm.

   18.  If there was no recipient for which all of the decryption steps
        succeeded, then the JWE MUST be considered invalid.  Otherwise,
        output the plaintext.  In the JWE JSON Serialization case, also
        return a result to the application indicating for which of the
        recipients the decryption succeeded and failed.

   Finally, note that it is an application decision which algorithms may
   be used in a given context.  Even if a JWE can be successfully
   decrypted, unless the algorithms used in the JWE are acceptable to
   the application, it SHOULD consider the JWE to be invalid.

9.  Mapping HPKE Keys to JWK for JOSE

   JWKs can be used to represent JOSE-HPKE private or public keys.  For
   the algorithms defined in this document, the valid combinations of
   the JWE Algorithm, "kty", and "crv" are shown in Figure 1.

   +---------------------+-----------------+
   | JWE Algorithm       | JWK |           |
   |                     | kty | crv       |
   +---------------------+-----+-----------+
   | HPKE-0, HPKE-7      | EC  | P-256     |
   | HPKE-1              | EC  | P-384     |
   | HPKE-2              | EC  | P-521     |
   | HPKE-3, HPKE-4      | OKP | X25519    |
   | HPKE-5, HPKE-6      | OKP | X448      |
   +---------------------+-----+-----------+

         Figure 1: JWK Types and Curves for JOSE-HPKE Ciphersuites

9.1.  JWK Representation of a JOSE-HPKE Key with HPKE Ciphersuite

   The example below is a JWK representation of a JOSE-HPKE public and
   private key:

   {
     "kty": "OKP",
     "crv": "X25519",
     "x": "3pPHgcHYVYpOpB6ISwHdoPRB6jNgd8mM4nRyyj4H3aE",
     "d": "nWGxne0tAiV8Hk6kcy4rN0wMskjl9yND0N3Xeho9n6g",
     "kid": "recipient-key-1",
     "alg": "HPKE-3",
     "key_ops": "encrypt"
   }

   It uses the "key_ops" value of "encrypt", which is appropriate when
   using integrated encryption.

10.  Security Considerations

   This specification is based on HPKE and the security considerations
   of [I-D.ietf-hpke-hpke] are therefore applicable also to this
   specification.

   HPKE assumes the sender is in possession of the public key of the
   recipient and HPKE JOSE makes the same assumptions.  Hence, some form
   of public key distribution mechanism is assumed to exist but outside
   the scope of this document.

   HPKE in Base mode does not offer authentication as part of the HPKE
   KEM.

   HPKE relies on a source of randomness being available on the device.
   In Key Agreement with Key Wrapping mode, the CEK has to be randomly
   generated.  The guidance on randomness in [RFC4086] applies.

10.1.  Key Management

   A single KEM key MUST NOT be used with multiple KEM algorithms.  Each
   key and its associated algorithm suite, comprising the KEM, KDF, and
   AEAD, should be managed independently.  This separation prevents
   unintended interactions or vulnerabilities between algorithms,
   ensuring the integrity and security guarantees of each algorithm are
   preserved.  Additionally, the same key should not be used for both
   key encryption and integrated encryption, as it may introduce
   security risks.  It creates algorithm confusion, increases the
   potential for key leakage, cross-suite attacks, and improper handling
   of the key.

10.2.  Review JWT Best Current Practices

   The guidance in [RFC8725] about encryption is also pertinent to this
   specification.

11.  Ciphersuite Registration

   This specification registers a number of ciphersuites for use with
   HPKE.  A ciphersuite is a group of algorithms, often sharing
   component algorithms such as hash functions, targeting a security
   level.  A JOSE-HPKE algorithm makes choices for the following HPKE
   parameters:

   *  KEM Algorithm

   *  KDF Algorithm

   *  AEAD Algorithm

   The "KEM", "KDF", and "AEAD" values are chosen from the IANA HPKE
   registry [IANA.HPKE].

   All JOSE-HPKE algorithm identifiers registered by this specification
   begin with the string "HPKE-".  Future JOSE-HPKE ciphersuite names
   registered MUST also follow this convention.
